This example demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs related to numeric data handling, specifically when dealing with implied decimal points in numeric fields. The issue is caused by assigning or using a value that does not match the data format defined by the PIC clause. This can lead to data truncation or inaccurate results. The solution shows how to correctly handle these values, ensuring data integrity and avoiding runtime errors.
